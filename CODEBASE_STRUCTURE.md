# Codebase Structure
The structure to socks is fairly simple - one module (i.e. .py file) per AWS service. 
- If a service has a common acronym or shorthand (like S3) then use that, elsewise prefer the full name (like athena) with no spaces
- Following standard Python naming standards all file names should be lowercase with single words preferred
